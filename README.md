=============

A small Processing script to display a tree with baubles run off the @cheerlights system.
Been tweaking it annually for the last few years.

Latest Snowy2020
1 Changed to cheer lights broker,
2 Changed how baubles change, now we have a trail top to bottom
3 Fixed timeout/disconnect after 30min.
